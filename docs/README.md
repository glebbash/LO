## 🪂 Top level expressions

Top level expressions are only allowed at the top level of the file (not inside functions).

### Function definition

```lo
fn add(x: u32, y: u32): u32 {
    return a + b;
};
```

#### Exporting functions

Function can be exported from WASM module like this:

```lo
export fn main(): u32 {
    return 0;
}
```

> Functions are exported with their original names

### Include

```lo
include "./file.lo";
```

Include pathes are relative to the file they are included to.

Will **not** include the same file twice.

File paths are fully resolved before including.

Example:

```lo
include "./abc.lo"; // will include
include "./some-folder/../abc.lo"; // will skip
```

## 🧑‍💻 Code Expressions

Code expressions are allowed inside function bodies.

### Integer literals

```lo
123 // u32 literal
0x3F // u32 hex literal, uppercase letters only
```

Int literals are always fully typed, there is no generic "number" type that will get narrowed later.

> Expression type: depends on the literal

### Return expressions

```lo
return 123;
```

> Expression type: `never`

### Binary operators

Binary operators require both operands to be of the same type.

```lo
1 + 2
```

#### Numeric operators

`+`, `-`, `*`, `>>`

> Expression type: Same as operand type

#### Comparision operators

`<`

> Expression type: `bool`

### If expressions

```lo
if x < 0 {
    return 1;
};
```

> Expression type: `void`

> NOTE: parens are not required around the condition

> NOTE: semicolon **is required** after if expression, it not optional like in C

Supports `else if` and `else` branches:

```lo
if x < 0 {
    // negative
} else if x > 0 {
    // positive
} else {
    // zero
};
```

### Function calls

```lo
add(2, 2);
```

> Expression type: same as function return type

## 🧱 Types

Types lol.

| LO Type | WASM  |
| ------- | ----- |
| `void`  | -     |
| `never` | -     |
| `bool`  | `i32` |
| `u32`   | `i32` |

> `never` type means that code execution will not reach this point.

## 💬 Comments

Only `//` comments are supported for now.

```lo
// this is a comment
fn main(): u32 {
    // this is another comment
    return 0;
};
```

Comments are allowed between any tokens, but they might get moved during formatting. See [Pretty Printing](#pretty-printing) for more info.

## 🔨 Compiler usage

Compiler is shipped as a standalone WASM binary: `lo.wasm`

It uses [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) preview 1 APIs for communication. This allows it to be executed in any WASI compatible runtime.

Example of running the compiler using [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/):

```bash
wasmtime --dir=. lo.wasm
```

This should print something like the following:

```text
Usage: lo <file> [mode]
  where [mode] is either:
    --inspect
    --pretty-print
  No [mode] means compilation to wasm
```

---

> NOTE: following examples will be using `lo` "executable". This is OS dependant and is not shipped with the compiler.
>
> In Linux/MacOS you can alias it to `wasmtime --dir=. lo.wasm $@`

### Compiling to WASM (main target)

```bash
lo input.lo
```

> Compiles `input.lo` file into a wasm module
>
> `<stdout>` - WASM module in binary format <br>
> `<stderr>` - Any compilation errors. See [error format](#error-format)

> NOTE: any imported files will be automatically resolved. You don't need to provide them separately.

### Inspecting code (IDE intergration)

```bash
lo input.lo --inspect
```

> Prints inspection info of `input.lo` file in JSON format. Useful for IDE integrations.
>
> `<stdout>` - JSON object with inspection results <br>
> `<stderr>` - Any compilation errors. See [error format](#error-format)

Inspection object schema is defined as `DiagnisticItem` in [VSCode extension sources](../vscode-ext/src/extension.ts)

### Pretty Printing

> NOTE: this feature is WIP and does not support the full syntax yet <br>
> NOTE: this currently does not resolve imports, processes only the single file

Usage:

```bash
lo input.lo --pretty-print
```

> Formats `input.lo` using non-configurable formatting style
>
> `<stdout>` - Formatted source <br>
> `<stderr>` - Any compilation errors. See [error format](#error-format)

#### Comment rearrangement

Comments that are placed in "weird" places will be moved into closest "proper" places.

This keeps formatter quite simple and makes comment placing more consistent.

For example the following:

```lo
// this is a comment
fn main():
// this will be moved
u32 { // this will also be moved
    // this is fine
    return 0; // this will also be moved
};
```

Will get formatted as:

```lo
// this is a comment
fn main(): u32 {
    // this will be moved
    // this will also be moved
    // this is fine
    return 0;
    // this will also be moved
};
```

### Error format

Errors are printed to `<stderr>` in the following format:

```text
<file-path>:<line>:<col> - <message>
```

This makes errors clickable in VSCode's terminal (and probably others).

> NOTE: Currently only a single error can be emitted.

## 🧪 Compiler development

### Building the initial compiler

- Requirements:
  - Install [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
  - Install nightly: `rustup toolchain install nightly`
  - Add WASM target: `rustup +nightly target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
  - You can also find configs for GitHub Codespaces and GitPod in this repo
- Run `./build.sh`

    > This will build the compiler with cargo, putting resulting WASM binary into `lo.wasm`

### Running tests

- Requirements:
  - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) for running tests
- Run `./utils.mjs test`

    > This runs tests defined in `utils.mjs`. Test programs are located in `examples/test`

> NOTE: there is currently no built-in testing solution in the compiler, existing test setup is good enough for now.
